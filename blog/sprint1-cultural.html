        <h1>Work vs Family</h1>
        
    <p>A biggest ethical decision I have every made was leaving my job. I was running a sports bar/night club at the time and I built help build it from 
        scratch and built a great team. I had been working for the same people for 7 years, they looked after me, payed me well and gave me all the time 
        off I needed to go away to see my son every 5 weeks. Until Ryan (my son) and his mum decided to move back Wellington. 
    </p>
    <p>This was my chance to see my son more, but my job was full on. And with Ryan turning 5 and school starting with me working nights it was always in 
        the back of my mind I would hardly see him as much as I wanted too. Do I give up the job I have been working so hard for or do I give up seeing Ryan more?
    </p>
    <p>I tried to make both work as much as I could, but this led me to losing a lot of sleep and wasn’t as motivated to be at work or wasn’t the type of dad I normally 
        am with Ryan. This got me thinking a lot. My mum always told me I was a good dad, and I would do anything for Ryan. I worked my ass off for money so Ryan could 
        have a decent life, but would it be a decent life if he hardly sees me. So, I took the plunge. I could always find another more job suitable. I gave my boss 3 
        months’ notice, trained up my replacement and went job hunting. Even though this was hard for my bosses to take in they understood.
    </p>
    <p>I found a job easy, but the pay was not as good as I expected but I was spending more time with Ryan. I was a lot happier, I could be there for Ryan a lot more and 
        spend time with him and I feel he was a happier too. </p>

    <h1>Strengths and Limitations</h1>
        <p>Throughout of my research a few words jumped out to me. Hardworking, competitive, understanding/approachable.  With each of these words I thought about how dose this relate to me.
             Each word I would associate with both my strengths and/or limitations. 
        I feel my work ethic would be one of my best strength to help me in my learning journey I always try to work to the best of my ability but also I sometimes work too much.
        </p>
        <p>A sitiation ith working in hospitality a lot of the work and been in a team. One of my favourite things was to train new people but with workload getting a bit big, so I handed
             over training to another manager. After a few weeks I found out the manager I handed over too was not training anyone properly and expected everyone to 
             know what to do after being shown once. This effected the whole business not just me. 
        </p>
        <p>I had to teach this manager again on how to train someone properly and she wasn’t happy about it. She is a bit older than me and didn’t like being told 
            how to do her job. I reminded her about the day she started and how I trained her for the whole week. She came around and understood what I was talking 
            about. I believe we could have not had this conflict if I went over training with her before handing it over. Yes she was confident to take this task but 
            just needed a recap on how and what to do.
