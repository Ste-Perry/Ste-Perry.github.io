        <h2> HTML & CSS</h2>
            <p>HTML and CSS are both coding languages that are used to create websites. A fun analogy for the relationship between HTML and
            CSS would be if the HTML is a bush/hedge and the CSS is a gardener. The hedge is shaped and manicured by the gardener,
            who will dictate the look and feel of the final outcome.
            </p>

        <h2>Control Flow & Loops</h2>
            <p>Control flow statements command how blocks of code are executed. They do this dependent on a series of decisions, loops and/or branching.
            Control Flow at work is a lot like choosing an outfit in the morning, loops would be the question you ask yourself to determine what is 
            correct to ware for the sitiation.
            </p>
            
        <h2> The DOM</h2>
            <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) a visual representation of how a user is structuring their HTML elements. The DOM is located in you preferred 
            internet browser eg Chrome. Within the DOM a user can change the structure of the HTML by adding, changing or deleting code without affecting the 
            website itself, kind of like a playground where you can playaround and see the effect. The DOM sees each element or 
            attribute as a 'node' and through JavaScript users are able to manipulate nodes at their will. I find the DOM incredibly useful for testing and
            identifying errors in my code, it's interface identifies what line the incorrect code is on and even gives a reason to why it hasn't parsed. 
            </p>

        <h2> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
            <p>An Array is a line of code that can store several pieces of data in one place. Array's use zero-based indexing to organised it's contents. It would be 
            fair to say that Objects are very similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access or manipulate data, the user would use properties 
            (ie. 'name').
            </p>

        <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h2>
            <p>Functions are collections of code that we divide up and reuse. The function is initiated by using the word 'function' followed by it's name ,   
            parentheses ( functionName() ) and then a pair of Curly Brackets. Any code can be stored between the brackets and will be executed when the function is called.
            Functions are useful because it reduces the amount of code a user needs to write, especially if they want 
            to use the same function on different value sets.
