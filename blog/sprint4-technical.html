      <h2> Got Blocked On A Simple Problem</h2>
      <p>
         Iâ€™ve run into a number of small problems learning Javascript, one in particular which seems ridiculous in hindsight and
         seems to be a bad habit I keep getting into was when doing the Kata challenge I found myself rushing into coding instead
         of fully understanding and planning the best way to attack the challenges. I found going through a process where I would
         read the challenge in it's entirety and then re-read it while translating it step by step on what i needed to do made a big 
         difference in my accuracy.
      </p>
      <h2>Solving A Problem In An Elegant Way</h2>
      <p>
         I found after doing a few of the kata things seemed to flow more after my mistake above. I was thinking a few steps ahead after reading all the tests.
         The olympics kata i found alot easier and things just flowed. Insted of just rushing in i made a plan on what needed to be done. 
         Did i little bit of reserch on parts i found a bit harder to achive the outcome and it worked.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h2>
      <p>
         Trying something, Rubber ducky method, Reading error messages and Googleing are my stongest points of problem solving.
         These methods seem to be my go too as i like playing around and seeing howand why things work.
         Pseudocode is there but i need to right it down insted of keeping it in my head.
         Asking for help seems to be a bit non-existenting as i like to find out infomation myself but i always know
         the help is there when the time comes i need it.
      </p>
