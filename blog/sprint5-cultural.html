      <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
         I enjoy thinking out loud and find talking through each step of a problem. When frustrated it is good strategy to think
         “what question do I need to ask to solve this problem“. I find myself I can take my time and think of the task ahead instead 
         of diving in and dealing with it when a problem when it arises.
      </p>
      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>
         Empathy is a particularly important skill to have when working with other people, being able to understand how somebody
         else is learning and how they are feeling has a direct result of how we communicate and ultimately getting things done
         as a team. We are only human after all
      <br>
         Having self-awareness of how you are feeling is important. Sometimes you will be working with a person or a project that
         you do not enjoy working with and being conscious of that fact can have a huge impact, just having the awareness allows
         you to the ability to choose how you respond, rather then just reacting to what you are given.
      </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
         The thing that has surprised me the most about core principles is how much it around in everyday jobs and life. Most of the core
         learning I knew already just from my personal experience in the workplace. I belive this should be tought at school to prepare
         everyone for there 1st job.
      </p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
         Writing the blogs was the most challenging for me. I knew what I wanted to say but finding the words to put down was
         hard, 'was it enough?', 'did i get my point across?' ETC. I was always changing my mine and knowing that everyone else would 
         read it was a bit daunting.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
          bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>
         It would make sense for any industry training organization to focus heavily on core skills, this is because 99% of all
         jobs require human to human interactions. For a company or team to be successful everybody in the team must be able to
         work together and move in the direction towards a common goal.
      <br>
         The reason I think EDA as a programming school focuses on human skill so heavily is because the essence of a
         programmer’s job is to solve problems. When solving problems in a team it is extremely easy for people to have differing
         ideas and ways of going about solving said problem. Frustrating can lead to a whole bunch of negative emotions and it is
         critical that we understand this and have tools to communicate and manage our emotions in a productive way.
      </p>
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
          practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p>    
         Focusing on core skills will never be a “waste of time”. I have learnt from previous jobs that human skills and your
         reputation within a company has a much greater weighting on your success then your technical abilities but having the
         skills to go along with it helps a lot too.
