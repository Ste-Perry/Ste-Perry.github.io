        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
        </h3>
        <p>To find a job that challenges me every day. Something that I will be constantly learning and progressing myself. 
         </p>
       
         <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
        <p>My ability to trust others with work has been a little problem. With my previous job I always had to double check my crew and micromange</p>

        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
        <p>I’m a hard worker and like to get things done this also leads me to work a bit more then I need to though. I also think I’m very approachable and 
            helpful and can provide help to anyone that needs it, even though I can be verry competitive at times.</p>

        <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
         <p>I plan to put in work every day and space out my work throughout the week aka not to smash it all out in one go. I will make sure I take breaks when needed also will ask my cohorts and facilitators when I’m in need of help/advice as I would do the same for them.</p>
        
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
        <p>I will always give thing a shot myself first, but I cannot figure it out I would pop a little message on the slack page or ask my Rose – my facilitator.</p>
        
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team. </h3>
        <p>To provide me with any help and feedback on my journey </p>
        
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as
             school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h3>
        <p>My son has consistent time with me on the weekends and every Wednesday night.</p>
