      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
         By understanding the principles of neuroplticity you can lift the ceiling on your capability. It allows you to work
         within a non restrictive framework and helps you to create more permanent/reinforced neuro connections in the brain. I
         will look to put these principles in to use while improving any existing skills or learning new ones in all aspects of
         my life so this becomes a habit. A good way to increase neuroplaticity is to try and form as many connections to the newly 
         learnt skill as possible, so this might be preforming the skill in a different context or explaining it in a new way.
         <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g">Here </a>is a resource that I found really helpful for explain neuroplasticity.

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
         The growth mindset is understanding that you can do something which makes it really important when learning new things.
         When people understand that they can learn something it increases their growth mindset making it easier for them.
         It's about getting past that wall of doubt you have in yourself. I found that im pritty open about my mindset and always 
         up to learning new thing. One of the reasons i joined up to Dev Acadamy.<br>
